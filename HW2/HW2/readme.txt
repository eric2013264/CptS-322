When I tested my program, it took around 10 seconds on my Windows 7 virtual machine to run 10,000 ints.
I asked Professor Evan Olds to test it and he detected no delay and stated the algorithm was ok since "There is some leniency on the time complexity requirements for this part".

You are aware of most of this, as he CC'ed you the email.

I hope you don't experience any delay when you run it on your computer.
